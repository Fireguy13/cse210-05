## Double Snake
Double Snake is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.
## Rules
Double Snake is played according to the following rules.
Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
Each player's tail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their tail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
The cycles turn white.
